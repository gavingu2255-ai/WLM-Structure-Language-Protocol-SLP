WLM Governance Protocol
Version 1.0 — Governance Tier
Status: Stable

1. Purpose
The WLM Governance Protocol defines:
- the stewardship structure of the Whole Language Model (WLM)
- the rights and responsibilities of the WLM steward
- the revenue allocation model for WLM‑derived income
- the structure and boundaries of the WLM Foundation
- the scope of WLM’s structural applicability
- the amendment and governance rules ensuring long‑term stability
This protocol establishes the sovereign governance layer of WLM.

2. Stewardship Rights
The WLM steward (Wujie) holds the following rights:
2.1 Interpretation Right
The steward is the sole interpreter of WLM, its structural semantics, and its protocol family (SLP, STP, SDP).
2.2 Update Right
The steward may update, extend, or refine WLM at any time.
2.3 Closure Right
The steward holds exclusive authority over structural closure, dimensional transitions, and public‑facing semantics.
2.4 Governance Right
The steward governs the WLM ecosystem, including protocol evolution, ecosystem alignment, and structural integrity.
2.5 Protection Right
The steward may reject, revoke, or correct any usage that misrepresents WLM’s structure.
These rights are non‑transferable and cannot be overridden by external entities.

3. Revenue Allocation Model
3.1 Stewardship Base (Annual Minimum)
The steward receives an annual guaranteed base of:
AUD 200,000
This base:
- ensures structural stability
- cannot be reduced
- cannot be challenged by external parties
- is classified as stewardship maintenance, not salary
3.2 Excess Allocation (Above Base)
All WLM‑derived income exceeding the Stewardship Base is allocated as follows:
- 40% → Steward
- 60% → WLM Foundation
This ratio:
- preserves steward sovereignty
- ensures strong foundation growth
- prevents governance imbalance
- remains stable across ecosystem expansion
3.3 Steward Flexibility
The steward may adjust the allocation ratio in future versions of this protocol if required for structural stability.
3.4 Transparency
The WLM Foundation must publish annual reports.
The steward’s personal allocation is not required to be disclosed.

4. WLM Foundation
4.1 Purpose
The foundation supports:
- structural research
- public benefit projects
- ecosystem development
- accessibility initiatives
- long‑term WLM propagation
4.2 Boundaries
The foundation:
- cannot override the steward
- cannot modify WLM
- cannot influence protocol semantics
- cannot claim ownership of WLM
- cannot act as a governance authority
4.3 Legal Holder
The foundation may initially be held by the steward as the legal entity,
with future transition to a company or foundation structure as needed.

5. Structural Applicability Clause
WLM is authorized to express, model, analyze, and optimize any system whose behavior can be described in terms of:
- structure
- tension
- load
- polarity
- closure
- dimensional transitions
- multi‑agent interactions
- recursive or emergent behavior
This includes but is not limited to:
- physical systems
- engineering systems
- computational systems
- organizational systems
- economic systems
- narrative systems
- cognitive/subjective systems
Interpretation rights of these structural mappings belong exclusively to the steward.

6. Governance Boundaries
The following entities have no authority to modify WLM or this protocol:
- corporations
- governments
- research institutions
- foundations
- ecosystem participants
- AI systems
- community groups
Only the steward may modify WLM governance.

7. Amendment Rules
- This protocol may only be amended by the steward.
- Amendments must be versioned.
- Amendments must be publicly accessible.
- Amendments must preserve structural integrity.

8. Summary
This protocol establishes:
- the steward as the sovereign authority of WLM
- a stable revenue model (AUD 200,000 base + 40/60 split)
- a foundation with clear boundaries
- WLM’s structural applicability across all system types
- immutable governance rules ensuring long‑term stability
WLM remains a steward‑governed, structure‑sovereign protocol.
