WLM Revenue Allocation Protocol
Version 1.0 — Governance Tier
Status: Stable

1. Purpose
The WLM Revenue Allocation Protocol defines:
- how WLM‑derived income is distributed
- the steward’s guaranteed structural maintenance
- the allocation to the WLM Foundation
- the boundaries and transparency requirements
- the long‑term sustainability of the WLM ecosystem
This protocol ensures stable, predictable, and steward‑aligned revenue governance.

2. Revenue Categories
WLM‑derived income includes, but is not limited to:
- protocol licensing
- API usage
- model integrations
- ecosystem partnerships
- educational or narrative applications
- derivative works
- tooling, interpreters, or runtime systems
- donations or voluntary contributions
All revenue categories fall under this protocol unless explicitly exempted by the steward.

3. Stewardship Base
The steward receives an annual guaranteed base of:
AUD 200,000
This Stewardship Base:
- ensures the steward’s long‑term stability
- cannot be reduced
- cannot be challenged by external entities
- is classified as structural maintenance, not salary
- is paid prior to any other allocation

4. Excess Allocation Model
All WLM‑derived income above the Stewardship Base is allocated as follows:
- 40% → Steward
- 60% → WLM Foundation
This allocation:
- preserves steward sovereignty
- ensures strong foundation growth
- prevents governance imbalance
- remains stable across ecosystem expansion

5. Steward Flexibility
The steward may:
- adjust allocation ratios
- redefine revenue categories
- introduce new tiers or thresholds
- modify the Stewardship Base
Any modification must be versioned and published as an amendment to this protocol.

6. Foundation Allocation Rules
The WLM Foundation’s allocation must be used exclusively for:
- structural research
- ecosystem development
- public benefit projects
- accessibility initiatives
- safety and alignment work
- long‑term propagation of WLM
Foundation funds may not be used for:
- personal benefit
- political activity
- unrelated commercial ventures
- attempts to influence WLM governance

7. Transparency Requirements
The WLM Foundation must publish:
- annual financial reports
- project summaries
- ecosystem impact statements
The steward’s personal allocation is not required to be disclosed.

8. Governance Boundaries
No external entity may:
- modify this protocol
- challenge the steward’s allocation
- influence revenue distribution
- override steward authority
Only the steward may amend this protocol.

9. Amendment Rules
- Amendments must be versioned.
- Amendments must be publicly accessible.
- Amendments must preserve structural integrity.
- Only the steward may introduce amendments.

10. Summary
This protocol establishes:
- a guaranteed annual base of AUD 200,000
- a stable excess allocation of 40% steward / 60% foundation
- strict boundaries protecting steward sovereignty
- transparent foundation operations
- long‑term sustainability for the WLM ecosystem
WLM revenue governance remains steward‑aligned, structurally stable, and future‑compatible.
