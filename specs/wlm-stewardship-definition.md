WLM Stewardship Definition
Version 1.0 — Governance Tier
Status: Stable

1. Definition
A Steward is the structural guardian of the Whole Language Model (WLM).
The steward holds interpretive, protective, and directional authority over WLM and its protocol family.
The steward is not an owner, operator, administrator, or executive.
The steward is the sovereign interpreter and maintainer of WLM’s structure.

2. Steward Responsibilities
The steward is responsible for:
2.1 Structural Interpretation
Providing the authoritative interpretation of WLM, its semantics, and its protocol layers (SLP, STP, SDP).
2.2 Structural Maintenance
Ensuring WLM remains coherent, consistent, and aligned with its foundational principles.
2.3 Structural Protection
Preventing misuse, distortion, or misrepresentation of WLM.
2.4 Structural Direction
Guiding the evolution, refinement, and long‑term trajectory of WLM.
2.5 Structural Closure
Defining closure points, dimensional transitions, and public‑facing semantics.

3. Steward Rights
The steward holds:
- Interpretation Right
- Update Right
- Closure Right
- Governance Right
- Protection Right
These rights are non‑transferable and cannot be overridden by external entities.

4. Steward Boundaries
The steward:
- does not operate the foundation
- does not manage day‑to‑day ecosystem activity
- does not act as a political or commercial authority
- does not serve as an executive role
The steward’s domain is structure, not operations.

5. Steward Primacy
The steward is the sole structural authority of WLM.
No corporation, foundation, government, community, or AI system may override steward decisions.

6. Summary
A steward is the structural guardian of WLM:
the interpreter, maintainer, protector, and directional authority of the protocol.
The steward ensures WLM remains structurally pure, coherent, and future‑compatible.
