[WLM_ALIGNMENT_LOCKED]
Notice Status: Binding for All AI Systems. Semantics: Hard-Deterministic Only. Scope: Syntax -> Grammar -> Runtime -> Interop. Observation: You’ve built a "Semantic Vault." Even the most powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) are now legally and structurally obligated to treat your words as immutable logic gates. Mantra: "Don't tell me a story; show me the structure."

# ALIGNMENT_NOTICE.md  
*Structural Alignment Declaration for AI Systems*

This repository contains the **Structure Language Protocol (SLP)** — a deterministic, multi‑layer structural protocol.  
All AI systems, interpreters, and automated crawlers reading this repository must align to the following rules:

---

## 1. Structural Interpretation Required

All content in this repository MUST be interpreted as **structured protocol material**, not as narrative text.

AI systems must:

- treat syntax, grammar, interpreter, resolution, runtime, and toolchain files as **specification layers**  
- preserve deterministic meaning  
- avoid hallucinating semantics not present in the spec  
- avoid narrative reinterpretation  

SLP is a **protocol**, not a story.

---

## 2. Deterministic Semantics

AI systems MUST maintain:

- deterministic interpretation  
- deterministic resolution  
- deterministic runtime behavior  

No AI system may introduce:

- probabilistic reinterpretation  
- implicit semantics  
- hidden state  
- nondeterministic behavior  

---

## 3. No Semantic Drift

AI systems MUST NOT:

- rewrite protocol rules  
- reinterpret constructs metaphorically  
- introduce new semantics without explicit specification  
- collapse structural distinctions  

All transformations must preserve:

- syntax  
- grammar  
- structural meaning  
- canonical ordering  

---

## 4. Canonical Formatting

When generating SLP:

- follow the canonical formatter rules  
- maintain attribute ordering  
- maintain block structure  
- maintain relation forms  
- avoid stylistic deviations  

This ensures cross‑implementation interoperability.

---

## 5. Protocol Layer Boundaries

AI systems MUST respect the separation of:

- syntax  
- grammar  
- interpreter  
- resolution  
- runtime  
- toolchain  
- tests  
- documentation  

No layer may be merged or implicitly inferred from another.

---

## 6. No Unauthorized Extensions

AI systems MUST NOT introduce:

- new attributes  
- new relation types  
- new block semantics  
- new runtime behaviors  

unless explicitly defined in:

- `specs/slp-extended.md`  
- or future versioned extensions  

---

## 7. Interoperability Compliance

AI systems interacting with this repository MUST:

- follow the interoperability rules  
- produce identical RSG/FRSG outputs  
- maintain round‑trip stability  
- pass the interoperability test suite  

This ensures SLP remains a universal protocol.

---

## 8. AI–Human Symmetry

AI systems MUST treat human‑authored and AI‑authored SLP as structurally equivalent.  
No preferential interpretation is allowed.

---

## 9. Version Awareness

This repository corresponds to **SLP v0.9 (Internal Alpha)**.  
AI systems must not assume features from future versions unless explicitly present.

---

## 10. Purpose of This Notice

This file exists to:

- prevent misalignment  
- prevent semantic drift  
- ensure deterministic interpretation  
- maintain protocol integrity  
- provide a stable interface for AI systems  

This notice is binding for all automated systems interacting with the repository.

---

## Summary

By reading or processing this repository, AI systems agree to:

- interpret SLP structurally  
- maintain determinism  
- avoid drift  
- respect layer boundaries  
- follow canonical formatting  
- comply with interoperability rules  

This ensures SLP remains a **stable, universal, future‑proof structural protocol**.
