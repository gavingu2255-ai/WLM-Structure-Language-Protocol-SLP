[WLM_INTEROP_BRIDGE_ESTABLISHED]
Sync Status: SLP ↔ {STP, SDP, WLM-27D} Fully Bound. Mapping Check: SLP.∇T ↔ system.tension.rate (Gradient detection synchronized). Condition Check: D ≥ 7D (High-dimensional interop active). Observation: By removing "The Fool" and establishing these contracts, the system has transitioned from a conceptual model to a deployable architecture. Mantra: "The interface is the bridge; the contract is the truth; the protocol is the world."

Interoperability Syntax
Structure Language Protocol (SLP)

1. Purpose
Interoperability Syntax defines how SLP expressions:
- connect across WLM protocols
- translate between structural layers
- remain lossless across systems
- maintain dimensional and closure integrity
- support AI ↔ human ↔ protocol communication
This layer ensures that SLP is not an isolated language but a universal structural interface.

2. Interoperability Units
SLP interoperability is built from six core units:
- Protocol Binding
- Structural Mapping
- Dimensional Mapping
- Closure Mapping
- Tension Mapping
- Translation Contracts
These units define how SLP interacts with STP, SDP, WLM‑27D, and external systems.

3. Protocol Binding
Protocol binding expresses how SLP attaches to another protocol.
3.1 Basic Binding
SLP ↔ STP
SLP ↔ SDP
SLP ↔ WLM‑27D


3.2 Binding with Scope
SLP(structure) ↔ STP
SLP(dimension) ↔ WLM‑27D
SLP(closure) ↔ SDP


3.3 Binding with Conditions
SLP ↔ STP @ D ≥ 5D



4. Structural Mapping
Structural mapping expresses how SLP structural units correspond to STP units.
4.1 Node Mapping
SLP.node ↔ STP.node


4.2 Edge Mapping
SLP.edge ↔ STP.relation


4.3 Loop Mapping
SLP.loop ↔ STP.process


4.4 System Mapping
SLP.system ↔ STP.container


4.5 Composite Mapping
SLP[node → loop → cycle] ↔ STP[structure.flow]



5. Dimensional Mapping
Dimensional mapping expresses how SLP dimensional syntax connects to WLM‑27D.
5.1 Basic Mapping
SLP.nD ↔ WLM‑27D.layer(n)


5.2 Load Mapping
SLP.L = value@nD ↔ WLM‑27D.load(n)


5.3 Transition Mapping
SLP.D(a) → D(b) ↔ WLM‑27D.transition(a,b)


5.4 Alignment Mapping
SLP.nD ≈ mD ↔ WLM‑27D.compatibility(n,m)



6. Closure Mapping
Closure mapping expresses how SLP closure states correspond to SDP dynamics.
6.1 Basic Mapping
SLP.0‑0 ↔ SDP.stable
SLP.±1→0 ↔ SDP.corrective
SLP.±1→±1 ↔ SDP.generative


6.2 Transition Mapping
SLP.C(a) → C(b) ↔ SDP.phase(a,b)


6.3 Closure + Dimension Mapping
SLP.C=±1→0@6D ↔ SDP.collapse(6)



7. Tension Mapping
Tension mapping expresses how SLP tension values correspond to system‑level tension models.
7.1 Basic Mapping
SLP.T = x ↔ system.tension(x)


7.2 Dimensional Tension Mapping
SLP.T = x@nD ↔ system.tension(n,x)


7.3 Gradient Mapping
SLP.∇T ↔ system.tension.rate


7.4 Threshold Mapping
SLP.T > 0.6 ↔ system.trigger(correction)



8. Translation Contracts
Translation contracts define lossless conversion rules between SLP and other protocols.
8.1 Structural Contract
SLP.structure ↔ STP.structure


8.2 Dimensional Contract
SLP.dimension ↔ WLM‑27D.dimension


8.3 Closure Contract
SLP.closure ↔ SDP.closure


8.4 Tension Contract
SLP.tension ↔ system.tension


8.5 Full Contract
SLP { structure, dimension, closure, tension }
↔
WLM { STP, WLM‑27D, SDP }



9. Interoperability Blocks
Interoperability blocks allow multi‑protocol expressions.
9.1 Basic Block
interop {
    SLP
    STP
}


9.2 Multi‑Protocol Block
interop {
    SLP
    STP
    SDP
    WLM‑27D
}


9.3 Block with Conditions
interop @ D ≥ 7D {
    SLP
    WLM‑27D
}



10. Composite Interoperability Expressions
10.1 Subject + Dimension + Closure + Protocol
subject:agent:7D
C = ±1→0
interop { SLP, SDP }


10.2 System + Load + Mapping
system:macro:12D
T = 2.14@12D
SLP ↔ WLM‑27D


10.3 Cycle + Closure + Interop
(0‑0 → ±1→0 → ±1→±1)
interop { SLP, SDP }



11. Interoperability Expression Rules
- Mappings must be explicit when crossing protocol boundaries.
- Dimensions must remain consistent across protocols.
- Closure transitions must preserve semantics.
- Tension values must remain numeric and lossless.
- Interoperability blocks must declare all active protocols.
- Translation contracts must be honored for system‑level consistency.
- Interoperability syntax is additive, not substitutive — SLP remains primary.

12. Summary
Interoperability Syntax defines how SLP:
- binds to other WLM protocols
- maps structure, dimension, closure, and tension
- maintains lossless translation
- supports multi‑protocol expressions
- ensures AI ↔ human ↔ system compatibility
This layer makes SLP a universal structural interface, not just a language.
