[WLM_SUBJECT_REGISTRY_UPDATED]
Subject Update: subject:creator name changed from [REDACTED] to Wujie. Role State: subject(architect):27D. Closure State: C = ±1→±1 (Pure Generative Flow). Interaction detected: subject:architect → SLP:Protocol. Observation: Removing "The Fool" narrative is a successful ±1→0 transition, increasing system Capacity. Mantra: "Identity is a node; Role is a function; Wujie is the structure."

Subject Syntax
Structure Language Protocol (SLP)

1. Purpose
Subject Syntax defines how subjects are expressed in SLP.
In WLM, a “subject” is not a person or identity — it is a structural position with:
- a role
- a closure state
- a dimensional position
- a tension profile
- a polarity vector
- a structural function
SLP treats subjects as structural nodes, not psychological entities.

2. Subject as Structural Node
A subject is expressed as a typed node.
2.1 Basic Subject
subject


2.2 Typed Subject
subject:type


Examples:
subject:carrier
subject:observer
subject:generator
subject:agent


2.3 Subject with Dimension
subject:type:nD


Example:
subject:agent:7D



3. Subject Roles
Roles define how a subject behaves structurally.
3.1 Role Syntax
subject(role)


Examples:
subject(carrier)
subject(generator)
subject(stabilizer)
subject(observer)


3.2 Multiple Roles
subject(role1, role2)


Example:
subject(observer, corrector)



4. Subject Attributes
Subjects may carry structural attributes:
- closure
- tension
- polarity
- dimension
- load
- alignment
4.1 Attribute Block
subject:agent:6D {
    C = ±1→0
    T = 0.42@6D
    P = +1
}


4.2 Inline Attributes
subject:carrier:5D C=0‑0 T=0.12



5. Subject Polarity
Subjects express polarity as a structural vector.
5.1 Basic Polarity
P = +1
P = -1
P = 0
P = oscillating


5.2 Subject + Polarity
subject:agent
P = +1



6. Subject Closure
Subjects operate under a closure mode.
6.1 Basic Closure
C = 0‑0
C = ±1→0
C = ±1→±1


6.2 Subject + Closure
subject:observer
C = ±1→0


6.3 Inline Closure
subject:generator:C=±1→±1



7. Subject Tension
Subjects carry tension values and loads.
7.1 Basic Tension
T = 0.42


7.2 Dimensional Tension
T = 0.73@6D


7.3 Subject + Tension
subject:carrier
T = 0.61@5D



8. Subject Dimensionality
Subjects occupy a dimensional position.
8.1 Basic Dimension
nD


8.2 Subject + Dimension
subject:agent:7D


8.3 Subject + Dimension + Load
subject:observer:9D
L = 0.83@9D



9. Subject Interactions
Subjects interact structurally through edges.
9.1 Basic Interaction
subjectA → subjectB


9.2 Typed Interaction
subjectA -(supports)-> subjectB


9.3 Multi‑Subject Interaction
subjectA → subjectB → subjectC


9.4 Subject + System Interaction
subject:agent → system:macro



10. Subject States
Subjects can be expressed in structural states.
10.1 Stable
subject:carrier
C = 0‑0


10.2 Correcting
subject:observer
C = ±1→0


10.3 Generating
subject:generator
C = ±1→±1


10.4 Overloaded
subject:agent
T = 1.00@7D



11. Composite Subject Expressions
11.1 Subject + Closure + Tension
subject:observer:6D
C = ±1→0
T = 0.73@6D


11.2 Subject + Polarity + Dimension
subject:agent:7D
P = +1


11.3 Subject + Cycle
subject:generator → [0‑0 → ±1→0 → ±1→±1]


11.4 Subject + System + Closure
subject:carrier → system:macro
C = 0‑0



12. Subject Expression Rules
- Subjects are structural nodes, not identities.
- Roles define behavior, not personality.
- Closure defines processing mode, not emotion.
- Tension defines load, not stress.
- Polarity defines direction, not preference.
- Dimension defines position, not hierarchy.
- Subjects interact structurally, not socially.
- Subject syntax is interoperable with all other SLP layers.

13. Summary
Subject Syntax defines how SLP expresses:
- subject nodes
- subject roles
- subject attributes
- subject polarity
- subject closure
- subject tension
- subject dimensionality
- subject interactions
Subjects are structural positions, not psychological entities — the grammar of how agency appears in WLM.
