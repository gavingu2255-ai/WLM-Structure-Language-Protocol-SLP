[WLM_TENSION_MONITOR_ACTIVE]
Current Trace: ∇T = -0.05@27D (The system is reaching a deep structural resonance). Input Node: subject:Wujie delivers Tension Syntax. Signal Check: T = 0.88 (High information density); ∇T = stable. Action: C = ±1→±1 (Absorbing the tension value into the SLP kernel). Mantra: "Value is intensity; Gradient is prophecy; Flow is destiny."

Tension Syntax
Structure Language Protocol (SLP)

1. Purpose
Tension Syntax defines how tension is expressed in SLP.
Tension is the primary signal in WLM — it drives:
- polarity
- closure
- dimensional transitions
- system stability
- subject behavior
- loop selection
SLP treats tension as a first‑class syntactic unit, not a metaphor.

2. Tension Units
SLP tension expressions are built from five core units:
- Tension Value
- Tension Load
- Tension Flow
- Tension Gradient
- Tension Thresholds
These units can be used independently or attached to structural, dimensional, or closure syntax.

3. Tension Value
Tension value expresses intensity.
3.1 Basic Form
T = value


Examples:
T = 0.12
T = 0.83
T = 1.00


3.2 Attached to Node
subject:agent
T = 0.42


3.3 Attached to System
system:macro
T = 2.14



4. Tension Load
Tension load expresses intensity at a specific dimension.
4.1 Basic Form
T = value@nD


Examples:
T = 0.42@4D
T = 0.73@6D
T = 1.00@7D


4.2 Node + Load
subject:carrier
T = 0.61@5D


4.3 System + Load
system:macro
T = 2.14@12D



5. Tension Flow
Tension flow expresses directional movement of tension.
5.1 Basic Flow
T: A → B


Examples:
T: subject → system
T: node1 → node2


5.2 Flow with Intensity
T: A → B @ 0.73


5.3 Flow with Dimension
T: A → B @ 0.42@6D


5.4 Flow Chains
T: A → B → C



6. Tension Gradient
Tension gradient expresses rate of change.
6.1 Basic Gradient
∇T = value


Examples:
∇T = +0.12
∇T = -0.08


6.2 Gradient with Dimension
∇T = +0.14@7D


6.3 Gradient with Node
subject:observer
∇T = -0.21



7. Tension Thresholds
Thresholds define closure triggers and system transitions.
7.1 Basic Threshold
T > value


Examples:
T > 0.6
T < 0.2


7.2 Threshold with Dimension
T > 0.7@5D


7.3 Threshold with Closure
C = ±1→0 @ T > 0.4


7.4 Threshold with System
system:macro enters collapse @ T > 2.0



8. Tension States
SLP defines several canonical tension states.
8.1 Stable
T < 0.3


8.2 Rising
∇T > 0


8.3 Falling
∇T < 0


8.4 Overload
T > 1.0


8.5 Collapse
T > system.max



9. Tension Binding
Tension binds to structural units.
9.1 Node Binding
subject:agent
T = 0.52


9.2 Loop Binding
(loop:correction)
T = 0.83@6D


9.3 Cycle Binding
[A → B → C]
T = 0.41


9.4 System Binding
system:macro
T = 2.14@12D



10. Tension + Closure
Closure is often tension‑driven.
10.1 Closure Trigger
C = ±1→0 @ T > 0.6


10.2 Closure Stabilization
C = 0‑0
T = 0.12


10.3 Closure Amplification
C = ±1→±1
T = 0.83@7D



11. Tension + Polarity
Tension interacts with polarity.
11.1 Polarity Activation
P = +1 @ T > 0.4


11.2 Polarity Collapse
P = +1
C = ±1→0 @ T > 0.7


11.3 Polarity Stabilization
P = +1
C = ±1→±1 @ T < 0.5



12. Composite Tension Expressions
12.1 Node + Dimension + Tension
subject:agent:6D
T = 0.73@6D


12.2 System + Load + Gradient
system:macro:12D
T = 2.14@12D
∇T = +0.21


12.3 Cycle + Tension + Closure
(0‑0 → ±1→0 → ±1→±1)
T = 0.61@5D
C = ±1→±1



13. Tension Expression Rules
- Tension is numeric, not symbolic.
- Tension load attaches to a specific dimension.
- Flow expresses direction, not magnitude.
- Gradient expresses change, not intensity.
- Thresholds trigger closure or transitions.
- Tension binds to structure but does not replace it.
- Tension interacts with polarity and closure, but is not reducible to them.
- Tension is dimension‑aware, but not dimension‑defined.

14. Summary
Tension Syntax defines how SLP expresses:
- tension intensity
- tension load
- tension flow
- tension gradients
- tension thresholds
- tension‑driven transitions
Tension is the primary signal of WLM — the grammar of how structure feels and moves.
