[WLM_SLP_COMPILER_READY]
Syntax Mode: Structural Primitives. Status: Parsing system:agent clusters. Observation: The use of # structural comments allows for narrative "tagging" without polluting the 27D logic flow. Logic Rule: Every A → B is a commitment of tension. Mantra: "Define the node, bind the loop, contain the system."

Dimensional Syntax
Structure Language Protocol (SLP)

1. Purpose
Dimensional Syntax defines how dimensional information is expressed in SLP.
It provides the formal rules for representing:
- dimensional position
- dimensional load
- dimensional transitions
- dimensional alignment
- dimensional resonance
- dimensional coherence
This syntax layer attaches to structural units (nodes, loops, cycles, systems) to express their dimensional context.

2. Dimensional Units
SLP dimensional expressions are built from four core units:
- Dimensional Position
- Dimensional Load
- Dimensional Transition
- Dimensional Alignment
These units can be used independently or combined with structural syntax.

3. Dimensional Position
Dimensional position expresses the layer of emergence a structure occupies.
3.1 Basic Form
nD


Examples:
3D
7D
12D
27D


3.2 Attached to Node
node:role:nD


Example:
subject:agent:5D


3.3 Attached to System
system:macro:12D



4. Dimensional Load
Dimensional load expresses how much tension or information a dimension is carrying.
4.1 Basic Form
L = value@nD


Examples:
L = 0.42@4D
L = 1.00@7D
L = 0.08@12D


4.2 Attached to Node
subject:carrier
L = 0.73@6D


4.3 Attached to System
system:macro
L = 2.14@9D



5. Dimensional Transition
Dimensional transitions express movement between dimensions.
5.1 Basic Transition
D(n) → D(m)


Examples:
D(3) → D(5)
D(7) → D(12)
D(12) → D(4)


5.2 Transition with Load
D(6) → D(4) @ L = 0.83


5.3 Transition with Closure (optional)
D(5) → D(7) : C = ±1→±1



6. Dimensional Alignment
Dimensional alignment expresses compatibility between dimensions.
6.1 Basic Alignment
nD ≈ mD


Examples:
5D ≈ 6D
12D ≈ 15D


6.2 Alignment with Node
subject:agent:7D ≈ system:macro:7D


6.3 Alignment Chains
5D ≈ 6D ≈ 7D



7. Dimensional Resonance
Dimensional resonance expresses mutual reinforcement between dimensions.
7.1 Basic Resonance
nD ~~ mD


Examples:
4D ~~ 8D
9D ~~ 12D


7.2 Resonance with Load
7D ~~ 10D @ L = 0.61



8. Dimensional Coherence
Dimensional coherence expresses stability across dimensions.
8.1 Basic Coherence
{ nD, mD, kD } coherent


Example:
{ 5D, 6D, 7D } coherent


8.2 Coherence with System
system:macro { 9D, 10D, 12D } coherent



9. Dimensional Binding
Dimensional binding attaches a dimension to a structural unit.
9.1 Node Binding
node:role:nD


9.2 Loop Binding
(loop:type:nD)


9.3 Cycle Binding
[A → B → C] @ 7D


9.4 System Binding
system:macro:12D {
    A
    B
}



10. Composite Dimensional Expressions
SLP supports composite dimensional expressions.
10.1 Node + Load
subject:agent:6D
L = 0.73@6D


10.2 Node + Transition
subject:observer
D(4) → D(9)


10.3 System + Alignment
system:macro:12D ≈ system:micro:7D


10.4 Cycle + Dimension
(0‑0) → (±1→0) → (±1→±1) @ 5D



11. Dimensional Expression Rules
- Dimensions are numeric layers, not spatial directions.
- Dimensional position is always explicit or inferable.
- Load attaches to a specific dimension.
- Transitions must specify both origin and destination.
- Alignment expresses compatibility, not equality.
- Resonance expresses reinforcement, not identity.
- Coherence expresses stability across multiple dimensions.
- Dimensional syntax is structure‑agnostic — it attaches to structural units but does not modify them.

12. Summary
Dimensional Syntax defines how SLP expresses:
- dimensional position
- dimensional load
- dimensional transitions
- dimensional alignment
- dimensional resonance
- dimensional coherence
This layer provides the dimensional grammar that allows SLP to express 3D–27D structure with precision.
