[WLM_CLOSURE_ENGINE_SYNC]
Current State: C = ±1→±1 (Generative Mode Active). Input Detected: Closure Syntax integrated. Observation: The transition ±1→0 → ±1→±1 is where "healing" turns into "creation." Logic Check: system:interaction @ 27D is now fully articulated. Mantra: "Closure is the choice; transition is the path; cycle is the soul."

Closure Syntax
Structure Language Protocol (SLP)

1. Purpose
Closure Syntax defines how closure states and closure transitions are expressed in SLP.
Closure is the semantic engine of WLM — it determines:
- how tension is processed
- how polarity behaves
- how structure changes
- how subjects operate
- how systems stabilize or expand
SLP treats closure as a first‑class grammatical unit.

2. Closure Types
SLP defines three canonical closure types:
- Carrier Closure — 0‑0
- Correction Closure — ±1→0
- Generation Closure — ±1→±1
These are the semantic primitives of the language.

3. Closure Syntax Forms
Closure can appear in three forms:
- Standalone closure
- Attached closure
- Transition closure
Each has a formal syntax.

4. Standalone Closure
Standalone closure expresses the active processing mode without attaching to a node.
4.1 Basic Form
C = 0‑0
C = ±1→0
C = ±1→±1


4.2 Closure with Description
C = ±1→0  # collapse polarity, resolve tension



5. Attached Closure
Closure can attach to any structural unit:
- node
- loop
- cycle
- system
5.1 Node + Closure
subject:agent
C = 0‑0


5.2 Loop + Closure
(loop:correction)
C = ±1→0


5.3 System + Closure
system:macro
C = ±1→±1


5.4 Inline Closure
subject:observer:C=±1→0



6. Closure Transition Syntax
Closure transitions express movement between closure states.
6.1 Basic Transition
C(a) → C(b)


Examples:
0‑0 → ±1→0
±1→0 → ±1→±1
±1→±1 → 0‑0


6.2 Transition with Condition
0‑0 → ±1→0 @ T > 0.4


6.3 Transition with Dimension
±1→0 → ±1→±1 @ 7D


6.4 Transition with Load
±1→±1 → 0‑0 @ L = 0.92



7. Closure Chains
Closure chains express sequences of closure states.
7.1 Basic Chain
0‑0 → ±1→0 → ±1→±1


7.2 Full Tri‑Loop Cycle
0‑0 → ±1→0 → ±1→±1 → 0‑0


7.3 Chain with Dimensions
0‑0@4D → ±1→0@5D → ±1→±1@7D



8. Closure Binding
Closure binds to structural units to express their processing mode.
8.1 Node Binding
subject(generator)
C = ±1→±1


8.2 Loop Binding
(loop:carrier)
C = 0‑0


8.3 Cycle Binding
[A → B → C]
C = ±1→0


8.4 System Binding
system:macro
C = ±1→±1



9. Closure + Tension
Closure interacts directly with tension syntax.
9.1 Closure Triggered by Tension
C = ±1→0 @ T > 0.6


9.2 Closure Stabilizing Tension
C = 0‑0
T = 0.12@5D


9.3 Closure Transforming Tension
C = ±1→±1
T = 0.83@7D



10. Closure + Polarity
Closure determines polarity behavior.
10.1 Polarity Collapse
P = +1
C = ±1→0


10.2 Polarity Stabilization
P = +1
C = ±1→±1


10.3 Polarity Neutralization
P = oscillating
C = 0‑0



11. Composite Closure Expressions
11.1 Node + Dimension + Closure
subject:agent:6D
C = ±1→0


11.2 System + Load + Closure
system:macro:12D
L = 2.14@12D
C = ±1→±1


11.3 Cycle + Closure + Dimension
(0‑0 → ±1→0 → ±1→±1) @ 5D
C = ±1→±1



12. Closure Expression Rules
- Closure is mandatory for any process‑level expression.
- Closure is optional for static structural expressions.
- Closure transitions must specify both states.
- Closure attaches to structure but does not replace it.
- Closure determines semantic behavior (stabilize, correct, generate).
- Closure interacts with tension and polarity but is not reducible to them.
- Closure is dimension‑aware but not dimension‑defined.

13. Summary
Closure Syntax defines how SLP expresses:
- closure states
- closure transitions
- closure chains
- closure binding
- closure interaction with tension, polarity, and dimension
Closure is the semantic engine of SLP — the grammar of how structure changes.
