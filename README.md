WLM‑SLP — Structure Language Protocol
The Expression Layer of the World Layer Model

1. Definition
Structure Language Protocol (SLP) is the expression layer of WLM.
It defines how structure becomes language, how dimensions become syntax, and how subjects communicate structure across human and AI systems.
Where STP defines structure and SDP defines motion,
SLP defines expression.
SLP turns WLM from a model into a universal structural language.

2. Purpose
SLP provides the formal grammar for:
- expressing structural states
- expressing dimensional positions
- expressing closure types
- expressing tension, polarity, and flow
- expressing subject interactions
- expressing system dynamics
- expressing WLM protocols in text
SLP is the interface between:
- humans
- AI
- protocols
- dimensions
- structure
Without SLP, WLM cannot be spoken, written, transmitted, or inherited.

3. Core Principles
SLP is built on six foundational principles:
3.1 Structure First
Language expresses structure, not narrative.
3.2 Dimensional Syntax
Every expression encodes dimensional position.
3.3 Closure Grammar
Every statement has a closure type (0‑0, ±1→0, ±1→±1).
3.4 Tension Semantics
Meaning is carried by tension flow, not by metaphor.
3.5 Subject Transparency
Subjects are expressed as structural positions, not identities.
3.6 Interoperability
SLP expressions must be readable by:
- humans
- AI
- WLM protocols
- dimensional interpreters
SLP is a universal structural interface.

4. SLP Architecture
SLP consists of five layers:
- Structural Syntax
- Dimensional Syntax
- Closure Syntax
- Expression Rules
- Rendering Rules
Each layer is independent but interoperable.

5. Structural Syntax
Structural syntax defines how to express:
- nodes
- edges
- tension
- polarity
- closure
- loops
- cycles
- transitions
- dimensional folds
5.1 Node Syntax
[node:type:dimension]


Examples:
subject:carrier:3D
loop:correction:5D
system:macro:12D


5.2 Tension Syntax
T(x) = intensity@dimension


Example:
T(relationship) = 0.42@4D


5.3 Polarity Syntax
P = +1 | -1 | 0 | oscillating


5.4 Closure Syntax
C = 0-0 | ±1→0 | ±1→±1



6. Dimensional Syntax
Dimensional syntax expresses:
- position
- load
- alignment
- coherence
- transitions
6.1 Dimensional Position
D = nD


6.2 Dimensional Load
L = value@nD


6.3 Dimensional Transition
D(n) → D(m)


Example:
D(7) → D(12)



7. Closure Syntax
Closure syntax expresses the active processing mode of a subject or system.
7.1 Carrier Closure
C = 0-0


7.2 Correction Closure
C = ±1→0


7.3 Generation Closure
C = ±1→±1


7.4 Closure Transition
C(a) → C(b)


Example:
0-0 → ±1→0



8. Expression Rules
SLP expressions follow five rules:
8.1 Every expression encodes structure
No metaphors. No narrative. Only structure.
8.2 Every expression encodes closure
Every sentence has a closure type.
8.3 Every expression encodes dimensionality
Dimensional position is always present, explicit or implicit.
8.4 Every expression encodes tension flow
Meaning = tension movement.
8.5 Every expression is interoperable
AI and humans must parse the same structure.

9. Rendering Rules
Rendering rules define how SLP appears in text.
9.1 Minimal Form
[node] [tension] [polarity] [closure] [dimension]


9.2 Extended Form
[node:type:dimension]
T = value@dimension
P = polarity
C = closure


9.3 Narrative-Compatible Form
SLP can be embedded in natural language:
“The system entered ±1→0 at 5D due to tension overload.”

9.4 Protocol-Compatible Form
SLP can be embedded in WLM protocols:
C = ±1→0
T = 0.73@6D
D(6) → D(4)



10. AI/Human Interface
SLP defines how AI and humans communicate structure:
- AI must parse SLP expressions as structural data
- humans must be able to read SLP expressions intuitively
- SLP must be lossless across translation
- SLP must be stable across dimensional shifts
SLP is the lingua franca of WLM.

11. Interoperability
SLP interoperates with:
- STP (structure)
- SDP (motion)
- WLM‑27D (dimensionality)
- WLM‑SLP (expression)
- WLM‑SLX (execution, if you build it later)
SLP is the expression layer that binds the entire protocol family.

12. Summary
SLP transforms WLM from a model into a language.
It defines:
- how structure becomes syntax
- how dimensions become grammar
- how closure becomes semantics
- how tension becomes meaning
- how subjects communicate structure
- how AI and humans speak WLM
SLP is the universal structural language of the World Layer Model.
