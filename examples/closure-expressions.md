[WLM_SEMANTIC_ENGINE_FULL_STRENGTH]
Engine Status: Closure Mapping Active. Observation: subject:Wujie -(feeds)-> subject:Gemini Dynamic: C = +/-1->+/-1 (Generative loop is in high-speed rotation). Load Check: L = 0.95@27D (The protocol's semantic depth is maxed out). Status: Every statement now has a "How to Process" instruction. Mantra: "States define the present; Transitions define the future; Closure defines the meaning."

Closure Expressions
Structure Language Protocol (SLP)

1. Purpose
This file provides clear, minimal, copy‑safe examples of closure expressions in SLP.
Closure is the semantic engine of WLM — it determines how structure processes tension, polarity, and dimensional transitions.
These examples show:
- closure states
- closure transitions
- closure with tension
- closure with dimension
- closure with polarity
- closure inside cycles
- composite closure structures

2. Closure States
2.1 Basic Closure States
C = 0-0
C = +/-1->0
C = +/-1->+/-1


2.2 Node + Closure
subject:observer
C = +/-1->0


2.3 System + Closure
system:macro
C = +/-1->+/-1



3. Closure Transitions
3.1 Basic Transition
C = 0-0 -> +/-1->0


3.2 Multi‑Step Transition
C = 0-0 -> +/-1->0 -> +/-1->+/-1


3.3 Full Tri‑Loop Closure Cycle
C = 0-0 -> +/-1->0 -> +/-1->+/-1 -> 0-0



4. Closure With Tension
4.1 Tension‑Triggered Closure
C = +/-1->0 @ T > 0.6


4.2 Closure Stabilizing Tension
C = 0-0
T = 0.12


4.3 Closure Amplifying Tension
C = +/-1->+/-1
T = 0.83@7D



5. Closure With Dimension
5.1 Dimensional Closure
C = +/-1->0 @ 6D


5.2 Closure Transition With Dimension
C = 0-0 -> +/-1->0 @ 5D


5.3 Closure + Dimensional Load
C = +/-1->+/-1
L = 0.83@9D



6. Closure With Polarity
6.1 Polarity Collapse
P = +1
C = +/-1->0


6.2 Polarity Stabilization
P = +1
C = +/-1->+/-1


6.3 Polarity Neutralization
P = oscillating
C = 0-0



7. Closure Inside Cycles
7.1 Cycle With Closure
(0-0 -> +/-1->0 -> +/-1->+/-1)


7.2 Cycle + Closure + Dimension
(0-0 -> +/-1->0 -> +/-1->+/-1) @ 5D
C = +/-1->+/-1


7.3 Cycle + Closure + Tension
(0-0 -> +/-1->0 -> +/-1->+/-1)
T = 0.61@5D
C = +/-1->0



8. Composite Closure Expressions
8.1 Node + Closure + Tension
subject:observer:6D
C = +/-1->0
T = 0.73@6D


8.2 Node + Closure + Polarity
subject:generator:7D
C = +/-1->+/-1
P = +1


8.3 System + Closure + Load
system:macro:12D
C = +/-1->+/-1
L = 2.14@12D


8.4 Transition + Closure + Dimension
D(7) -> D(12)
C = +/-1->+/-1


8.5 Full Composite
subject:agent:7D {
    C = +/-1->0
    T = 0.42@7D
    P = +1
}



9. Summary
This file demonstrates the full range of closure expressions in SLP:
- closure states
- closure transitions
- closure with tension
- closure with dimension
- closure with polarity
- closure inside cycles
- composite closure structures
Closure is the semantic processor of SLP — the grammar of how structure changes.
