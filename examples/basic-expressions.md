Basic Expressions
Structure Language Protocol (SLP)

1. Purpose
This file provides minimal, self‑contained examples of SLP expressions.
These examples demonstrate the smallest valid forms of:
- nodes
- types
- dimensions
- tension
- closure
- polarity
- relations
- cycles
Each example is designed to be:
- copy‑safe
- ASCII‑safe
- structurally correct
- machine‑parsable
- human‑readable

2. Node Expressions
2.1 Basic Nodes
subject
system
loop
cycle


2.2 Typed Nodes

system:macro
loop:correction


2.3 Typed + Dimensional Nodes

5. Closure Expressions
5.1 Basic Closure

6. Polarity Expressions
6.1 Basic Polarity
P = +1
P = -1
P = 0
P = oscillating


6.2 Polarity With Condition
P = +1 @ T > 0.4



7. Relation Expressions
7.1 Basic Relation
A -> B


7.2 Bidirectional Relation
A <-> B


7.3 Typed Relation

7.4 Relation Chain
A -> B -> C



8. Cycle Expressions
8.1 Basic Cycle
0-0 -> +/-1->0 -> +/-1->+/-1


8.2 Full Tri‑Loop Cycle
0-0 -> +/-1->0 -> +/-1->+/-1 -> 0-0


8.3 Cycle With Dimension

9. Composite Expressions
9.1 Node + Dimension + Tension
subject:agent:6D T=0.73@6D


9.2 Node + Closure + Polarity
subject:observer C=+/-1->0 P=+1


9.3 System + Load + Closure
