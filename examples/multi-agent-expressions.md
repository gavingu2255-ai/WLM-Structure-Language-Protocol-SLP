[WLM_MULTI_AGENT_SIMULATOR_BOOTING]
Environment: Distributed System Logic. Scan: subject:A -(tension)-> subject:B -(closure)-> subject:C. Analysis: Closure Desynchronization detected between A and B. Fix: Applying subject:C(stabilizer) to synchronize C = +/-1->0. Observation: You've created a "Social Compiler" that can debug human interactions. Mantra: "Relation is flow; flow is tension; tension is the system's breath."

Multi‑Agent Expressions
Structure Language Protocol (SLP)

1. Purpose
This file provides clear, minimal, structurally correct examples of multi‑agent interactions in SLP.
These examples show how multiple subjects:
- interact
- exchange tension
- align or misalign dimensions
- synchronize or desynchronize closure
- form systems
- propagate cycles
- stabilize or destabilize each other
Multi‑agent structure is one of the most powerful uses of SLP.

2. Basic Multi‑Agent Relations
2.1 Simple Directional Relation
A -> B


2.2 Bidirectional Relation
A <-> B


2.3 Typed Relation
A -(supports)-> B


2.4 Relation Chain
A -> B -> C



3. Multi‑Agent With Types
3.1 Typed Agents
subject:observer -> subject:carrier


3.2 Mixed Roles
subject:generator -> subject:corrector -> subject:carrier


3.3 Multi‑Role Agent
subject(observer, stabilizer) -> subject:agent



4. Multi‑Agent With Dimensions
4.1 Dimensional Interaction
subject:agent:5D -> subject:observer:7D


4.2 Dimensional Alignment
subject:agent:7D ~= subject:carrier:7D


4.3 Dimensional Mismatch
subject:observer:4D -> subject:generator:12D


4.4 Dimensional Transition Between Agents
subjectA:agent:6D -> subjectB:observer:9D

5. Multi‑Agent Tension Flow
5.1 Basic Tension Flow

5.2 Multi‑Step Flow
T: A -> B -> C


5.3 Flow With Intensity

5.4 Flow With Dimension
T: A -> B @ 0.42@6D


5.5 Reciprocal Tension
T: A <-> B @ 0.61



6. Multi‑Agent Closure Dynamics
6.1 Agents With Different Closure States
A:observer
C = +/-1->0

B:generator
C = +/-1->+/-1


6.2 Closure‑Driven Interaction
A -(corrects)-> B
A:observer C=+/-1->0
B:agent    C=+/-1->+/-1


6.3 Closure Synchronization
A C=0-0
B C=0-0


6.4 Closure Desynchronization
A C=0-0
B C=+/-1->+/-1



7. Multi‑Agent Cycles
7.1 Two‑Agent Cycle
A -> B -> A


7.2 Three‑Agent Cycle
A -> B -> C -> A


7.3 Cycle With Closure
A -> B -> C -> A
C = +/-1->0


7.4 Cycle With Dimension
(A -> B -> C -> A) @ 7D



8. Multi‑Agent Systems
8.1 Basic System
system {
    A
    B
}


8.2 System With Relations
system:macro {
    A -> B
    B -> C

8.3 System With Attributes
system:macro:12D {
    A -> B
    T = 2.14@12D
}


8.4 Multi‑Agent System With Closure
system:macro {
    A
    B
    C
    C = +/-1->+/-1
}



9. Composite Multi‑Agent Expressions
9.1 Multi‑Agent + Dimension + Tension
subjectA:agent:6D -> subjectB:observer:9D
T: subjectA -> subjectB @ 0.73@6D


9.2 Multi‑Agent + Closure + Polarity
subjectA:generator:7D
C = +/-1->+/-1
P = +1

subjectB:observer:7D
C = +/-1->0
P = -1


9.3 Multi‑Agent Cycle + Dimension + Tension
(A -> B -> C -> A) @ 5D
T = 0.61@5D


9.4 Full Multi‑Agent Composite
system:macro:12D {
    subjectA:agent:7D
    subjectB:observer:9D
    subjectC:carrier:12D

    subjectA -> subjectB
    subjectB -> subjectC
    subjectC -> subjectA

    T: subjectA -> subjectB @ 0.73@7D
    T: subjectB -> subjectC @ 0.61@9D

    C = +/-1->+/-1
}



10. Summary
This file demonstrates the full range of multi‑agent expressions in SLP:
- multi‑agent relations
- typed interactions
- dimensional alignment and mismatch
- tension flow across agents
- closure synchronization and desynchronization
- multi‑agent cycles
- multi‑agent systems
- composite multi‑agent structures
These examples form the foundation for modeling collective behavior, distributed cognition, and system‑level dynamics in SLP.
