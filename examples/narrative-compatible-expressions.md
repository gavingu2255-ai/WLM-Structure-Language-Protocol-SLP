[WLM_NARRATIVE_PROCESSOR_ACTIVE]
Current Mode: Bionic Reading (Natural + Structural). Input Trace: The team was stuck in (0-0 -> +/-1->0 -> +/-1->+/-1) @ 5D. AI Understanding: It's not just "stuck"; it's a repetitive generative loop at dimension 5 that lacks a higher-dimensional exit. Action: Proposing D(5) -> D(7) transition protocol. Observation: Narrative is the "Carrier"; SLP is the "Content." Mantra: "Story is the skin; Structure is the soul; Code is the bridge."

Narrative‑Compatible Expressions
Structure Language Protocol (SLP)

1. Purpose
This file demonstrates how SLP expressions can be embedded inside narrative, descriptive, or explanatory text while remaining:
- structurally valid
- ASCII‑safe
- grammatically correct
- machine‑parsable
- readable by humans
These examples show how SLP can coexist with natural language without collapsing into metaphor or ambiguity.

2. Inline SLP Inside Narrative Sentences
2.1 Basic Inline Expression
She shifted from C = 0-0 to C = +/-1->0 as the tension rose.


2.2 Inline Dimension
He was operating at subject:observer:7D when the system changed.


2.3 Inline Tension
The conversation stayed stable at T = 0.12 until the mismatch appeared.


2.4 Inline Relation
Their interaction followed A -> B even though both expected A <-> B.



3. Narrative With Embedded Multi‑Expression Lines
3.1 Multi‑Attribute Inline
She entered the room as subject:agent:6D C=+/-1->0 T=0.42@6D.


3.2 Inline Cycle
He was clearly stuck in (0-0 -> +/-1->0 -> +/-1->+/-1) for most of the day.


3.3 Inline Dimensional Transition
The moment she understood, her state shifted from D(5) -> D(7).



4. Narrative Blocks With SLP Statements
4.1 Narrative Paragraph + SLP Block
He tried to stabilize the situation, but the underlying structure was already shifting:

subject:observer:6D {
    C = +/-1->0
    T = 0.73@6D
}


4.2 Narrative + System Block
The team dynamic could be summarized structurally as:

system:macro:12D {
    A -> B
    B -> C
    T = 2.14@12D
}



5. Dialogue With Embedded SLP
5.1 Dialogue With Inline Closure
"I’m fine," she said, but her state was clearly C = +/-1->0.


5.2 Dialogue With Dimensional Position
"You're thinking at 5D," he replied. "Try shifting to 7D."


5.3 Dialogue With Tension
"Your T = 0.83@7D is showing," she joked.



6. Narrative Descriptions Using SLP Structure
6.1 Describing Behavior With Closure
He moved through the conversation in C = 0-0, absorbing everything without reacting.


6.2 Describing Misalignment
They were operating at 5D ~= 6D — close, but not quite aligned.


6.3 Describing Resonance
Their ideas hit a perfect 7D ~~ 10D resonance.


6.4 Describing Tension Flow
The tension flowed T: A -> B long before either of them noticed.



7. Narrative‑Compatible Multi‑Agent Structures
7.1 Narrative + Multi‑Agent Relation
The group split into two clusters: A -> B on one side, C <-> D on the other.


7.2 Narrative + Multi‑Agent Cycle
They kept repeating the same loop: A -> B -> C -> A, unable to break the pattern.


7.3 Narrative + Multi‑Agent Attributes
A was in C = 0-0, B was in C = +/-1->0, and C was deep in C = +/-1->+/-1.



8. Narrative‑Compatible Composite Expressions
8.1 Full Inline Composite
She entered as subject:generator:7D C=+/-1->+/-1 T=0.83@7D P=+1.


8.2 Narrative + Transition + Closure
As the discussion deepened, his state shifted D(6) -> D(9) while C = +/-1->0.


8.3 Narrative + Cycle + Dimension
He was looping through (0-0 -> +/-1->0 -> +/-1->+/-1) @ 5D without noticing.


8.4 Narrative + System + Multi‑Agent
The entire interaction could be modeled as:

system:macro:12D {
    A:agent:7D
    B:observer:9D
    C:carrier:12D

    A -> B
    B -> C
    C -> A

    T: A -> B @ 0.73@7D
    T: B -> C @ 0.61@9D
}



9. Summary
This file demonstrates how SLP expressions can be embedded inside narrative contexts:
- inline expressions
- narrative paragraphs with SLP blocks
- dialogue with embedded structure
- descriptive narrative using closure, tension, and dimension
- multi‑agent narrative structures
- composite narrative‑compatible expressions
These examples show how SLP can coexist with natural language while remaining structural, precise, and machine‑parsable.
