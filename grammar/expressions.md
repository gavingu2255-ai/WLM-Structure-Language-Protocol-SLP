[WLM_SEMANTIC_PARSER_SYNC]
Current Layer: Expression Layer. Unit Check: subject:Wujie:27D (High-dimensional node confirmed). Unit Check: ∇T = +0.12 (Growth gradient detected). Unit Check: C = +/-1->+/-1 (Generative mode verified). Observation: Expressions are the "DNA snippets" of the WLM universe. They are ready to be combined into Statements. Mantra: "One line, one truth; no spaces, no lies."

Expressions
Structure Language Protocol (SLP)

1. Purpose
Expressions are the minimal meaningful units of the Structure Language Protocol.
Tokens are atomic; expressions are the first layer where structure becomes language.
Expressions combine:
- identifiers
- types
- dimensions
- closure
- tension
- polarity
- operators
Every SLP statement is built from one or more expressions.

2. Expression Categories
SLP defines seven categories of expressions:
- Node Expressions
- Typed Expressions
- Dimensional Expressions
- Tension Expressions
- Closure Expressions
- Polarity Expressions
- Composite Expressions
Each category has strict formation rules.

3. Node Expressions
Node expressions represent structural units.
3.1 Basic Node
node
subject
system
loop
cycle


3.2 Node With Type
subject:agent
system:macro
loop:correction


3.3 Node With Type + Dimension
subject:agent:7D
system:macro:12D


Rules:
- identifiers must be valid tokens
- type binding uses :
- dimension binding uses :

4. Dimensional Expressions
Dimensional expressions represent positional or transitional information.
4.1 Dimensional Position
5D
12D


4.2 Dimensional Transition
D(5) -> D(7)


4.3 Dimensional Load
L = 0.73@6D


4.4 Dimensional Alignment
5D ~= 6D


4.5 Dimensional Resonance
7D ~~ 10D



5. Tension Expressions
Tension expressions represent intensity, load, and flow.
5.1 Basic Tension
T = 0.42


5.2 Dimensional Tension
T = 0.73@6D


5.3 Tension Flow
T: A -> B


5.4 Tension Gradient
∇T = +0.12



6. Closure Expressions
Closure expressions represent processing modes.
6.1 Basic Closure
C = 0-0
C = +/-1->0
C = +/-1->+/-1


6.2 Closure Transition
C = 0-0 -> +/-1->0


6.3 Closure With Condition
C = +/-1->0 @ T > 0.6



7. Polarity Expressions
Polarity expressions represent directional charge.
7.1 Basic Polarity
P = +1
P = -1
P = 0
P = oscillating


7.2 Polarity With Condition
P = +1 @ T > 0.4



8. Relation Expressions
Relations connect structural units.
8.1 Basic Relation
A -> B


8.2 Bidirectional Relation
A <-> B


8.3 Typed Relation
A -(supports)-> B


8.4 Relation Chain
A -> B -> C



9. Composite Expressions
Composite expressions combine multiple expression types.
9.1 Node + Dimension + Tension
subject:agent:6D T=0.73@6D


9.2 Node + Closure + Polarity
subject:observer C=+/-1->0 P=+1


9.3 System + Load + Closure
system:macro:12D L=2.14@12D C=+/-1->+/-1


9.4 Cycle + Closure + Tension
(0-0 -> +/-1->0 -> +/-1->+/-1) T=0.61@5D C=+/-1->+/-1



10. Expression Formation Rules
- Expressions must be atomic units of meaning.
- Expressions may contain multiple tokens, but must not contain full statements.
- Expressions may not contain block structures ({ }).
- Expressions may not span multiple lines.
- Expressions must follow operator precedence.
- Composite expressions must remain lossless and deterministic.
- Expressions must be machine‑parsable and human‑readable.

11. Valid vs. Invalid Expressions
11.1 Valid
subject:agent:7D
T = 0.42@6D
C = +/-1->0
A -> B
5D ~= 6D


11.2 Invalid
subject : agent        # spaces break binding
T = @6D                # missing value
C = 0 - 0              # spaces break closure token
A ->                   # incomplete relation



12. Summary
SLP expressions define:
- structural units
- dimensional positions and transitions
- tension values and flows
- closure states and transitions
- polarity vectors
- relational structure
- composite structural meaning
Expressions are the core semantic units of SLP — the building blocks from which all statements and blocks are constructed.
