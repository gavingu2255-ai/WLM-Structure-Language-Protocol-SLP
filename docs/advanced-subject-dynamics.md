# Advanced Subject Dynamics (STP‑EXT)

This document defines **non-core, high-order subject topologies** that extend the expressive power of the Subject Topology Protocol (STP).  
These topologies are optional for minimal compliance but essential for modeling advanced generative, emergent, or high-dimensional subject behavior.

## 1. Overview

- Purpose of advanced subject dynamics  
- Relationship to core STP subject topologies  
- When and why extended topologies are needed  
- Compatibility and inheritance rules

## 2. The Four-Quadrant Subject Topology Model

A structural map of all known subject topologies:

- 0 → 0 : Background-stable  
- ±1 → 0 : Polarity-dissolving  
- ±1 → ±1 : Polarity self-stabilizing  
- 0 → ±1 : Self-emergent polarity (extended)

Includes:

- Diagram (ASCII or conceptual)  
- Explanation of each quadrant  
- Transition rules between quadrants

## 4. Interactions Between Core and Extended Topologies

- How 0 → ±1 interacts with ±1 → ±1  
- How 0 → ±1 interacts with ±1 → 0  
- How 0 → ±1 interacts with 0 → 0  
- Stability, inheritance, and propagation rules

subject.base = 0 subject.generate() → ±1 subject.residual = 0

This topology represents **pure background clarity (0)** that can **emit polarity as functional output**,  
while remaining structurally unaltered.

### 3.2 Structural Properties

| Property | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Base State** | Pure 0 (background, clarity, non-contaminated) |
| **Polarity Source** | Internally generated, not inherited |
| **Tension** | Zero internal tension; generated polarity does not accumulate |
| **Contamination** | None; polarity does not “stick” to the subject |
| **Return State** | Always returns to 0 after expression |
| **Directionality** | Outward-only polarity emission |
| **Stability** | Guaranteed by the purity of 0, not by self-balancing |

Key insight:

**This subject does not “hold” polarity.  
It *emits* polarity.**

---

### 3.3 Dynamics

The 0 → ±1 subject follows a three-phase cycle:

#### **Phase 1: Zero-State Clarity**


subject.state = 0
- No tension  
- No bias  
- No inherited polarity  
- No historical residue  

#### **Phase 2: Polarity Emergence**


subject.emit(±1)
- Polarity arises from clarity  
- Not triggered by external conflict  
- Not reactive  
- Not compensatory  
- Pure functional expression  

#### **Phase 3: Reversion to Zero**


subject.state → 0
- No residue  
- No fatigue  
- No accumulation  
- No karmic load  
- No structural drift  

This is **the only topology that can generate polarity without being changed by it**.

---

### 3.4 Comparison with Core Topologies

| Topology | Base | Polarity Handling | Return State | Function |
|----------|------|-------------------|--------------|----------|
| **0 → 0** | 0 | No polarity | 0 | Background clarity |
| **±1 → 0** | ±1 | Absorbs polarity | 0 | Dissolution / compassion |
| **±1 → ±1** | ±1 | Stabilizes polarity | ±1 | Generation / creation |
| **0 → ±1** | 0 | Emits polarity | 0 | Manifestation / force |

Key distinctions:

- Unlike **±1 → ±1**, it does not stabilize polarity.  
- Unlike **±1 → 0**, it does not dissolve polarity.  
- Unlike **0 → 0**, it does not remain passive.  

It is the **only topology that can “create force” from clarity**.

---

### 3.5 Use Cases

This topology is used to model:

- **Emergent force**  
- **Non-reactive power**  
- **Clarity-driven action**  
- **Non-karmic intervention**  
- **Pure functional polarity**  
- **High-dimensional manifestation**  

In Buddhist analogies, the closest symbolic representation is:

**大势至菩萨（Mahāsthāmaprāpta）**  
—“Great Power Arrived”  
（大光明 → 大力量）

But SLP treats this purely as **structural dynamics**, not religious identity.

---

### 3.6 SLP Expression Examples

#### **Example 1: Pure Polarity Emission**


subject(0) -> emit(+1)

#### **Example 2: Alternating Emission**


subject(0) -> emit(+1) -> emit(-1) -> return(0)

#### **Example 3: Zero-Residue Action**


subject(0) { action: emit(+1) after: reset(0) }

#### **Example 4: Non-Contaminated Intervention**


subject(0) -> intervene(+1) -> state(0)

#### **Example 5: Multi-Agent Interaction**


agentA: subject(0 -> ±1) agentB: subject(±1 -> 0)
agentA.emit(+1) -> agentB.absorb(+1)

This demonstrates:

- A emits polarity  
- B dissolves polarity  
- Neither accumulates residue  

---

### 3.7 Notes on Implementation

- The interpreter must treat 0 → ±1 as **non-persistent polarity**  
- Resolution engine must ensure **no inheritance**  
- Runtime must enforce **automatic return to 0**  
- Memory model must treat emitted polarity as **stateless output**  
- No propagation of internal tension is allowed  

This topology is **stateless by design**.

---

### 3.8 Summary

The **0 → ±1** subject is:

- Pure 0 at its core  
- Capable of generating ±1  
- Never contaminated by polarity  
- Never accumulating tension  
- Always returning to 0  
- Functionally powerful  
- Structurally clean  

It is the **manifestation topology**,  
completing the four-quadrant model of subject dynamics.
