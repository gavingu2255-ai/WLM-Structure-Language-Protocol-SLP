*Structure Language Protocol (SLP) — Roadmap*

A forward‑looking, versioned plan for the evolution of the Structure Language Protocol.  
This roadmap is intentionally structural, not feature‑driven — every milestone corresponds to a closure event in the protocol’s development.

---

# 1. Vision

SLP is designed to become a **universal structural protocol** — a deterministic substrate for representing and evolving structure across:

- humans  
- AI systems  
- organizations  
- knowledge graphs  
- multi‑agent environments  
- cognitive architectures  

The roadmap ensures SLP evolves **without drift**, **without fragmentation**, and **without breaking compatibility**.

---

# 2. Release Philosophy

SLP follows three principles for versioning:

1. **Stability first** — no breaking changes without a major version.  
2. **Determinism always** — new features must not introduce ambiguity.  
3. **Extensibility without drift** — extensions must preserve the core protocol.

Versions are defined by **structural closure**, not by feature count.

---

# 3. Version Timeline

## **SLP v0.9 — Internal Alpha (Complete)**  
Status: ✔ Achieved  
Scope:

- Full syntax  
- Full grammar  
- Interpreter (RSG)  
- Resolution engine (FRSG)  
- Runtime engine  
- Toolchain (formatter, validator, linter, CLI)  
- Complete test suite  
- Documentation set  

This is the version you have now — the protocol is structurally whole.

---

## **SLP v1.0 — Public Specification Release**  
Status: ⏳ Upcoming  
Goals:

- Freeze syntax and grammar  
- Freeze interpreter and resolution semantics  
- Freeze runtime behavior  
- Publish canonical specification  
- Publish reference implementation  
- Publish test suite as compliance standard  
- Establish versioned governance model  

Outcome:  
SLP becomes a **public, stable, referenceable protocol**.

---

## **SLP v1.1 — Interoperability Expansion**  
Status: Planned  
Goals:

- Multi‑language reference implementations  
- Cross‑runtime consistency tests  
- JSON/YAML import/export refinements  
- GraphViz canonical export  
- AI‑executor interoperability guidelines  

Outcome:  
SLP becomes **multi‑ecosystem compatible**.

---

## **SLP v1.2 — Structural Extensions**  
Status: Planned  
Goals:

- Extended attribute families (e.g., load, weight, stability)  
- Extended relation types (typed propagation families)  
- Optional metadata blocks  
- Optional annotation layer  

Outcome:  
SLP becomes **more expressive** without losing determinism.

---

## **SLP v2.0 — Dynamic Structure Protocol**  
Status: Future  
Goals:

- Real‑time structural updates  
- Multi‑agent runtime coordination  
- Event subscription model  
- Structural diff/patch protocol  
- Distributed runtime semantics  

Outcome:  
SLP becomes a **live structural substrate** for multi‑agent systems.

---

## **SLP v3.0 — Cognitive Integration Layer**  
Status: Future  
Goals:

- Cognitive graph primitives  
- Structural attention models  
- AI‑native reasoning hooks  
- Structural embeddings  
- Bidirectional human–AI structural interfaces  

Outcome:  
SLP becomes a **cognitive protocol**, not just a structural one.

# 4. Governance Roadmap

SLP will transition through three governance phases:

### **Phase 1 — Author Stewardship (Now)**  
- Single‑source authority  
- Rapid iteration  
- Internal coherence  

### **Phase 2 — Foundation Stewardship (v1.0+)**  
- Neutral governance  
- Versioned releases  
- Public RFC process  

### **Phase 3 — Standards Body Stewardship (v2.0+)**  
- ISO/W3C/IETF‑style protocol governance  
- Multi‑implementation certification  
- Long‑term stability  

---

# 5. Compatibility Policy

SLP follows a strict compatibility model:

- **Minor versions**: backward compatible  
- **Patch versions**: fully compatible  
- **Major versions**: may introduce structural changes, but with migration tools  

No version will ever break:

- canonical formatting  
- deterministic interpretation  
- deterministic resolution  
- runtime safety guarantees  

---

# 6. Milestones by Layer

### **Syntax & Grammar**
- v1.0 freeze  
- v1.2 extension families  
- v2.0 dynamic syntax (optional)

### **Interpreter**
- v1.0 canonical RSG  
- v1.1 multi‑language implementations  
- v2.0 streaming interpretation

### **Resolution**
- v1.0 deterministic FRSG  
- v1.2 extended propagation families  
- v3.0 cognitive resolution hooks

### **Runtime**
- v1.0 stable runtime  
- v2.0 distributed runtime  
- v3.0 cognitive runtime

### **Toolchain**
- v1.0 full suite  
- v1.1 interoperability harness  
- v2.0 distributed tooling

---

# 7. Long‑Term Direction

SLP is designed to become:

- a **structural standard**  
- a **cognitive substrate**  
- a **multi‑agent coordination protocol**  
- a **universal representation layer**  

The long‑term vision is a world where:

- humans think in structure  
- AI reasons in structure  
- systems communicate in structure  
- organizations evolve in structure  

SLP is the shared language that makes this possible.

---

# 8. Summary

The SLP roadmap is built around structural closure:

- **v1.0** — public, stable protocol  
- **v1.1–1.2** — interoperability + extensions  
- **v2.0** — dynamic, distributed structure  
- **v3.0** — cognitive integration  

Each version expands SLP’s expressive power while preserving its core principles:

- determinism  
- clarity  
- safety  
- interoperability  
- minimalism  

SLP is designed to grow for decades without losing its structural integrity.

## Advanced Subject Dynamics (STP‑EXT)

SLP will introduce an extended module for modeling **non-core subject topologies** that go beyond the minimal specification.  
This module expands the expressive capacity of the protocol and enables representation of high-order generative or emergent subject behavior.

### Planned Additions

- **0 → ±1 : Self‑Emergent Polarity Subject**  
  A subject whose base state is structural zero (0) and which can self-generate polarity (±1) without inheriting tension or contamination.

- Integration of the **Four-Quadrant Subject Topology Model**, including:
  - 0 → 0 (Background-stable)
  - ±1 → 0 (Polarity-dissolving)
  - ±1 → ±1 (Polarity self-stabilizing)
  - 0 → ±1 (Self-emergent polarity)

### Goals

- Provide a unified framework for advanced subject dynamics  
- Maintain backward compatibility with the core STP specification  
- Ensure interpreter and runtime neutrality  
- Allow optional adoption by implementations without requiring full compliance  

### Status

- Specification: In progress  
- Syntax integration: Complete (subject-syntax.md)  
- Documentation: In progress (advanced-subject-dynamics.md)  
- Implementation: Deferred to post‑1.0 releases
