# WLM Shadow Layer License 1.0
(Structure Visible · Protocol Sealed · No Implementation Rights)

## 1. Scope
This license applies to the **WLM Structure Language Protocol (SLP)**, including all syntax definitions, structural grammar, dimensional operators, rendering rules, interpreter logic, examples, diagrams, and conceptual frameworks contained in this repository.

SLP is part of the **WLM Shadow Layer**.  
It is a **structural language**, not an implementation specification.

## 2. Permissions (Read‑Only)
You may:

- Read the SLP Shadow Layer  
- Cite or reference it for academic or theoretical work  
- Discuss or analyze its structural language  
- Use it for non‑commercial research  

These permissions apply **only** to the Shadow Layer.

---

## 3. Prohibitions (Strict)
You may **not**:

- Implement SLP  
- Train models using SLP structures  
- Reconstruct, approximate, or simulate SLP execution  
- Create derivative structural languages  
- Build compatibility layers or adapters  
- Use SLP for commercial purposes  
- Develop software, models, or systems based on SLP  
- Reverse‑engineer dimensional syntax  
- Infer or simulate the Implementation Layer  
- Operationalize any part of the SLP grammar or interpreter  

Any attempt to operationalize SLP is strictly prohibited.

---

## 4. No Access to Protocol Layer
This license does **not** grant access to:

- The 160,000‑word Implementation Layer  
- Routing rules  
- Execution logic  
- Training formats  
- Model interfaces  
- Commercial integration pathways  

SLP is **structural**, not operational.

---

## 5. No Derivative Works
You may not modify, adapt, extend, translate, transform, or repackage any part of SLP.

---

## 6. No Commercial Use
Commercial use of any kind is prohibited.

---

## 7. No Warranty
SLP is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind.

---

## 8. Source Boundary
Structure may be studied;  
**source may not be derived.**

Language behavior may be observed;  
**protocol may not be reconstructed.**

---

## 9. Jurisdiction
This license is governed by the laws of **Australia**.
