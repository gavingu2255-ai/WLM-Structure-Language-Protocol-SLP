STRUCTURE LANGUAGE PROTOCOL (SLP)
STRUCTURAL LICENSE v0.9
--------------------------------

This license governs the use, reproduction, modification, and distribution of
the Structure Language Protocol (SLP) and all materials contained in this
repository.

SLP is a structural protocol. Its licensing model is designed to ensure:

1. Universal accessibility
2. Non‑enclosability
3. Structural integrity
4. Deterministic interoperability
5. Freedom to use, extend, and propagate
6. Protection against asymmetric extraction

This license is intentionally minimal, explicit, and future‑proof.

--------------------------------
SECTION 1 — DEFINITIONS
--------------------------------

“Protocol” refers to the Structure Language Protocol (SLP), including syntax,
grammar, interpreter rules, resolution rules, runtime semantics, examples,
tests, and documentation.

“Structural Work” refers to any derivative work that:
- implements the protocol,
- extends the protocol,
- interoperates with the protocol,
- or uses the protocol as a representational substrate.

“Contributor” refers to any individual or entity submitting changes to the
Protocol or Structural Work.

“User” refers to any individual or entity using, implementing, or distributing
the Protocol or Structural Work.

--------------------------------
SECTION 2 — PERMISSIONS
--------------------------------

Users are granted the following irrevocable rights:

1. **Use**  
   You may use the Protocol for any purpose, including commercial, academic,
   research, or personal applications.

2. **Modify**  
   You may modify the Protocol or create Structural Works, provided that such
   modifications do not misrepresent the Protocol as canonical.

3. **Distribute**  
   You may distribute the Protocol or Structural Works in any medium.

4. **Implement**  
   You may implement the Protocol in any programming language, runtime, or
   environment.

5. **Extend**  
   You may create extensions, provided they are clearly marked as extensions and
   do not claim to replace or supersede the canonical Protocol.

--------------------------------
SECTION 3 — CONDITIONS
--------------------------------

The following conditions apply to all use:

1. **Attribution**  
   You must include a reference to the Structure Language Protocol (SLP) and
   this license in any distribution or Structural Work.

2. **Non‑Enclosure**  
   You may not impose additional restrictions that would prevent others from
   exercising the rights granted by this license.

3. **Integrity of Canonical Specification**  
   You may not present modified versions of the Protocol as canonical.  
   Canonical versions are those published in the official SLP repository.

4. **Interoperability Transparency**  
   If your implementation deviates from the canonical Protocol, you must clearly
   document the deviation.

5. **No Structural Extraction**  
   You may not enclose, privatize, or claim ownership over structural concepts,
   patterns, or semantics defined by the Protocol.

--------------------------------
SECTION 4 — PROTECTIONS
--------------------------------

1. **Anti‑Enclosure Clause**  
   No entity may claim exclusive rights over:
   - the syntax of SLP,
   - the grammar of SLP,
   - the structural semantics of SLP,
   - the runtime model of SLP,
   - or any derivative structural pattern.

2. **Impedance Clause**  
   Any attempt to enclose or privatize the Protocol automatically grants all
   Users the right to fork and continue the Protocol under this same license.

3. **No Warranty**  
   The Protocol is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind.

4. **No Liability**  
   Contributors and maintainers are not liable for any damages arising from use
   of the Protocol.

--------------------------------
SECTION 5 — VERSIONING
--------------------------------

This license applies to SLP v0.9.  
Future versions may refine the language but will preserve:

- openness  
- non‑enclosability  
- structural integrity  

--------------------------------
SECTION 6 — SUMMARY
--------------------------------

You are free to use, modify, implement, extend, and distribute SLP, provided
you:

- preserve attribution,
- do not enclose the protocol,
- maintain structural integrity,
- and clearly distinguish canonical vs. extended versions.

SLP is a protocol for everyone.  
Its structure must remain free, open, and interoperable.
